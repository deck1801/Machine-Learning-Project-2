# Machine-Learning-Project-2

## Advance Data Exploratory Anlysis
## Different Machine learning language comparision

This Project is  bases advance exploratory data analysis and testing different machine learning algortihms.
The dataset used for this project is from kaggle website called Titanic Dataset which  basically consits of inforamtion about 1309 passengers which are travelling on the ship.The dataset is splitted into two parts Train set and Test set.
Train set:891 passeger details and lables they survived or not (1/0)
Test set :892-1309 passenger details but no labels

All the proces done of Jupyter Notebook:
Direct Installation Command (Windows):- pip install jupyter  (python-(3.6/3.7) must be installed on the system)
Anaconda installation: link- https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ (The jupyter notebook present in the Anaconda Navigator by default)

The notebook conists:
1. All libraries used for the project
2. cleaning the dataset
3. Exploratory Data Analysis(Advanced)
4. Experimenting witha different type of classification algorithm
5. Final model implementation (kaggle Accuracy Achived:79% )
6. Train data Accuracy:83%

Enjoy the work!
